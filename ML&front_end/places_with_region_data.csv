As they were new, it was a breath of fresh air because I had easily been in lines for over an hour due to the holiday rush.  As I arrived at the self-checkout, a cashier came to me to assist. Now, my first thought was, of course, she was racially profiling me and trying to prevent me from stealing anything.  Nonetheless, I stepped back and allowed her to assist, giving her the benefit of the doubt. Now, I had already scanned a few items which were in a bag in front of me.  I had 6 Roblox boxes remaining.  As she is scanning the Roblox\'s, I asked her to put the items in the bag flat so I could maximize space and stay organized, as my SUV was already filled to the brim as I had been out shopping all day.  This was probably my 6th or 7th Ross.  She scoffed and ignored me, and that\'s when I realized she wasn\'t here to help, but more so to control me. She refused my request and I asked her to step away.  She stated, ""I\'m only trying to help"" as they always to do mask their racism.  We are always the crazy ones and jump to conclusions, right?  The racism is just in our heads, right?  She finally obliged and stepped away but took my first bag and put it behind her counter.  At the time, I didn\'t realize it.  One of the Roblox didn\'t have a tag on it, so I double-scanned one, checked all of the items she scanned to ensure they were in the system, and double-checked all of the SKUs to match what was on screen in case I needed to return anything. I completed the transaction, gathered my items, and then realized my other bag was missing. I stepped back and looked around in confusion, then saw the corner of the green Nickelodeon slime set, along with the other items I just paid for, behind her desk.  I walked over to grab it, and this woman tried to get there before me, we simultaneously grabbed the bag, she was holding on to it and wouldn\'t let go.  I\'m blown away. I, of course, already knew from the initial interaction that this was simply a case of racism.  I calmly and slowly pulled the bag from her grip as I looked her dead in the eye and didn\'t say a word.  That\'s what she was looking for, a fight.  This was a total setup but I wasn\'t going for it. At this point, I had all my paid items.  I take a step towards the door, she jumps in front of me saying, ""Show me your receipt!""  I offered no response, calmly reversed back into the store, walked around the jewelry counter, and exited.  I was in complete shock.\n\nI dropped my items in my car and came back in to get names and pictures of her.  Security in front wouldn\'t tell me her name.  The cashier closest to the interaction stated her name was Barbara, and that she was the manager.  Wow.  The manager.  I went to the back, used the restroom before leaving, and upon coming out of the restroom, I could overhear the manager on the earpiece of the employee who mans the fitting areas.  That\'s when I realized they probably talked to each other to have me watched.  They were watching me the whole time. I told the fitting area girl that I heard them talking about me, and that they were simply racist, and she snapped at me like some ghetto child.  I just laughed and walked away.\n\nRoss has shown a consistent track record of racial profiling and they keep getting worse and worse.']",f67f1070f260f1cb4ccdba31b71271d5,65139,35.7,96096,64.56,21.06,91,108,83,63.67,75,13.35,328,12,98

And she said I still have to ( I don’t see any sign indicates “ line for returning and online picking up “ )\nI said sorry to her . But her face was still dislike and she didn’t say anything and walked way to take my 3 packs of soda . I realized she didn’t take a cart for putting the items, and I realized I didn’t take a cart either while I’m pregnant and I can’t carry by my hands .  So I grabbed a cart , and came back to her. She pointed my items and said “ Here , yours “ I was so upset and didn’t want to say Thank you . And it made me think “ why she treat me like that even I didn’t ask her to help me . She called me over her booth . I was happy to wait a person doing online pick up booth. If she wasn’t happy when I walked pass to her to booth online pick up, so she just needs leave me alone or told me someone else will help, that’s it “\nI left the store with the feeling so upset.  Never happened to me since I have worked at my work place next to Target in 5 years .\n10/29/2024', ""I like the fact that this store has several self checkouts.
